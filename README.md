# Here are seven features of KiCad, an open-source PCB design tool:
⦁	Schematic Capture: KiCad allows users to create and edit electronic schematics, which are essential for designing circuit layouts and understanding the connections between components.

⦁	PCB Layout: The tool includes a PCB layout editor that enables users to design printed circuit boards, place components, route traces, and define board dimensions.

⦁	3D Viewer: KiCad has a built-in 3D viewer that provides a realistic visualization of the PCB design, allowing users to inspect the board from different angles and check for design issues.

⦁	Component Library: KiCad includes a comprehensive library of electronic components, with symbols for schematics and footprints for PCB layout. Users can also create custom components.

⦁	DRC (Design Rule Check): The software features design rule checking to help ensure that the PCB design meets manufacturing specifications and standards, reducing the risk of errors.

⦁	Netlist Generation: KiCad can generate netlists, which are files that define the electrical connections between components in the schematic and are used for PCB layout.

⦁	Version Control Integration: KiCad supports integration with version control systems like Git, allowing users to track changes to their PCB designs and collaborate with others more effectively.
